LEAF is based on [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for discrete-event simulation and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for modeling infrastructure or application graphs made by [Philipp Wiesner and Lauritz Thamsen](https://github.com/dos-group/leaf/)

The Files for the Simulations can be found in the leaf folder, which has the basic leaf files that have been predefined, as well as the source code that was written for the scenarios that were formed. 

The baseline scenario is defined in the baseline.py file
The scenario with the mobile, and mobile data connectivity (Scenario 3) is in scenario3.py
There are other files for the simulations that were conducted including the Optimised Scenario, and the comparative baseline scenario. 

In order to run the files, the setup.py file in the folder can be executed.  
In addition, pip install -r requirements.txt could be used to ensure that all the necessary packages are added.
